When users go to build or run their games, an intricate process is
invoked in the [ENIGMA compiler](ENIGMA_compiler "wikilink") which
ultimately results in the code being compiled with and linked against
the [ENIGMA engine](ENIGMA_engine "wikilink"). Often referred to simply
as **the Engine**, the ENIGMA engine is responsible for maintaining
[resources](resources "wikilink"), storing
[instances](instances "wikilink"), offering fast
[iteration](iteration "wikilink"), executing
[events](events "wikilink"), maintaining and accessing
[variables](variables "wikilink"), offering a reliable selection of
[functions](functions "wikilink"), and a great number of other features.

While most of the Engine is static, a deal of it is generated by the
[ENIGMA compiler](ENIGMA_compiler "wikilink") specifically for the game
at hand (See the [Code
Generation](ENIGMA_compiler#Generation "wikilink") section for details).
